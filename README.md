# 📁Dynamic Form (Using OOPs + Inheritance) :

This project is a dynamic form built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input data, which is then displayed dynamically on the page. The highlight of this project is the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript, specifically inheritance, to structure and manage form data efficiently.

## 🚀 Features :


  ✅ Clean and modern UI
  
  ✅ JavaScript OOP structure using classes and inheritance
  
  ✅ Real-time data capture and display
  
  ✅ Code is modular, readable, and easy to maintain
  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used :

 ✅ HTML
 
 ✅ CSS
 
 ✅ Bootstrap
 
 ✅ JavaScript

## 🚀 How It Works :

 1) User fills in the form fields.
 
 2) On form submission, JavaScript captures the input values.
 
 3) A base class (User) stores the form data using a constructor.
 
 4) A child class (UserDisplay) inherits from User and handles data display.
 
 5) The submitted data is dynamically shown on the page using DOM manipulation.
